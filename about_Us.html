                <h1>Clement Motloutsi</h1>

                <p>I was born in Tzaneen, Limpopo and I went to Tshwane university of Technology to further my studies.<br>
                 As I was busy with my studies, I was so fascinated by the relationship between human and computers.<br>
                  I kept asking myself how computers follow exactly what they are being instructed to do.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p>
                  I wanted to understand what kind of procedure do they go through to achieve the stated instructions.<br>
                   As I researched, I found out that they have  their own language that can be used by human to communicate with them.<br>
                  They simply follow a set of instruction of a program.<br><br>

                <p>I realised that computers makes life much easier and if used effectively, they can solve most of our daily problems.<br>
                 I was so interested in building my own computer program that can solve real life problems but I didn’t know how to do it.<br>
                  So I decided to learn how to code but I struggled as I didn’t have any guidance on how to do it and I mostly relied on You tube.<br>
                   I tried but I had to quit as I felt like it was not for me.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p>My interest for building stuff did not end. I went back to learning but I still struggled.<br>
                    I realised that I did not have enough time to learn so many things as I was busy with my studies on the other side.<br>
                     I tried building few projects but I struggled. I didn’t know how to start and in what manner.<br>
                    I will continue learning and this time around, I will learn by building projects.<br><br>
                    
                    Thank you for reading
